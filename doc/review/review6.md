# Review-6

### Lecture Date : 09/27/16

##  Theory

1. Explain: DE's build new examples by extrapolating between known ones.
1. Explain the following DE constants:
    * What is np and how is it used?
    * What is cf and how is it used?
    * What is f and how is it used?
1. Describe the crossover from Differential Evolution? How is it different from the crossover employed during the GA workshop?
1. Give a reasonable size for the frontier with respect to the number of decisions
1. Distinguish between the following two kinds of DE algorithms:
    * DE/rand/1
    * DE/best/2

## Practice

1. Write down, in 10 lines or less, pseudo-code for extrapolation in DE.
