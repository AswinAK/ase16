# Review-3

### Lecture Date : 09/06/16

##  Theory
1. What is ordered and unordered search. In what way are they different?
3. What is the drawback of greedy search?
2. Why do you think SA was so popular in 1950s?
7. Is SA a single objective or a multiojective optimization algorithm?
4. How would you terminate a stochastic algorithms such as SA sooner?
5. What is mutation? Give an example.
6. What type of surfaces(objective spaces) will SA find hard to optimize?


## Practice
1. In about 10 lines, write down the pseudo-code for SA. Number each line.
2. In the pseudo-code for SA, you used a neighbourhood function Neighbour(). Code up the Neighbour function.
3. In the pseudo-code for SA, you used a probability function P(e_new, e_old, t). What would be a valid mathematical expression for this? How would you change this for a maximization problem?
