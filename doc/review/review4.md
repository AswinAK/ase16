# Review-4

### Lecture Date : 09/13/16

##  Theory

1. State few drawbacks of stochastic optimizers.
2. What is pareto optimality? Describe using a graphical example.

1. What is the problem with local maxima?

1. In the following diagram, each square has the same x,y,z axis. What might the names of those x,y,z values?

2. Explain the following, using the above diagram:

 * Holes
 * Poles
 * Saddles
 * Local minima
 * Flat
 * Brittle

3. Explain the following term and describe how it handles the problem of flat: Retries.

4. How does the following techniques avoid the problems of local maxima?

  Simulated annealing
    - Retries
    - Momentum (make sure you explain momentum)
  
5. Local search can be characterized as follows

   + Jump all around the hills
   + Sometimes, sitting still while rolling marbles left and right
   + Then taking one step along the direction where the marbles roll the furthest.
   + Go to 1.

In the following code snippet, explain where you'd find "local search".
```
FOR i = 1 to max-tries DO
  solution = random assignment
  FOR j =1 to max-changes DO
    IF  score(solution) > threshold
        THEN  RETURN solution
    FI
    c = random part of solution 
    IF    p < random()
    THEN  change a random setting in c
    ELSE  change setting in c that maximizes score(solution) 
    FI
RETURN failure, best solution found
```
