## Indents matter

Everyone on the team should ahve the **same** indent policies in their IDE

- Menzies: 2 spaces, "tab" injects 2 spaces.
- Mathew: ??

## Style matters

Everyone of the same team should use the same coding conventions:

- Menzies: use `i` for `self`
- Everyone else in the whole work: use `self` for `self`

Don't matter what, but all members of the team should use the same style guidelines

- e.g. Style guide: http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html
